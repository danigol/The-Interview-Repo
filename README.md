# The Interview Repo

You've heard this one before: make an app that hits this API and displays it. 

They're looking that you know your way around an app, that you can architect something, and, perhaps most importantly, that you can explain it. 

App architecture **is** important. It improves performance, testing, readability, even reduces conflicts in pull requests. 

That's why this sets up just the bare minimum. The real work is still there to do, but at least you won't have to spend half the time during your interview in dependency hell while trying to explain that you definitely are an Android engineer, you just can't remember what version of Hilt works with which version of Kotlin and if Compose also works with those versions and... you get the point. 

It's a starting point, you've still got to work the magic.
